After a commish or admin attempts to reach you without a response back, you will be placed on auto and your opponent will be granted the opportunity to play your cpu. If you tell your opponent 5, 10, 15 mins etc..., that can &amp; will be used as a set game time, and your opponent can provide that as proof (your 30 min grace period will start after that time as past). Contact &amp; notify a commissioner if your opponent fails to respond within 3 - 5 hours of you reaching out or if your opponent does not respond before 3 o'clock CST so that someone can assist you in some way, form, or fashion.

We will put an opponent on auto as soon as we can if proper proof was provided showing that your opponent was 30 mins late for a set game time.
